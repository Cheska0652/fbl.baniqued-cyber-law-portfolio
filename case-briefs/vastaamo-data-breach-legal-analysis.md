# Vastaamo Data Breach (Finland, 2018–2020)

**Jurisdiction:** Finland (EU)  
**Industry:** Healthcare / Psychotherapy  
**Data Involved:** Sensitive Personal Information (Health Data)

---

## 1. Case Overview

Vastaamo, a private psychotherapy clinic in Finland, suffered a large-scale data breach resulting from unauthorized access to its patient database as early as 2018. The breach was publicly disclosed in October 2020, revealing that attackers had accessed psychotherapy records containing highly sensitive personal data, including therapy notes and diagnoses.

The stolen data was later used to extort both the organization and individual patients, threatening public disclosure of psychotherapy records if ransom demands were not met. The incident affected tens of thousands of data subjects and caused severe psychological and reputational harm.

## 2. Key Facts

- Unauthorized access began in 2018  
- Breach publicly disclosed in October 2020  
- Psychotherapy records were stored without adequate security controls  
- Individual patients were targeted for extortion  
- Data was published incrementally after ransom demands failed  

---

## 3. Applicable Law (EU / Finland)

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The Finnish Data Protection Authority found that Vastaamo violated multiple provisions of the GDPR, including:

- **Article 32** – Failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures *(security of processing)*[^1]  
- **Article 33** – Failure to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay following a personal data breach[^2]  
- **Article 34** – Failure to promptly communicate the breach to affected data subjects[^3]  
- **Article 5(1)(f)** – Violation of the integrity and confidentiality principle[^4]  
- **Article 5(2)** – Failure to demonstrate accountability for compliance[^5]  
- **Articles 24–25** – Failure to implement data protection by design and by default[^6]  

Given the sensitivity of health data, the lack of encryption and insufficient access controls were considered particularly serious violations.

---

## 4. Regulatory Findings and Outcome

The Finnish Data Protection Authority imposed an administrative fine of **€608,000** on Vastaamo for systemic security failures and delayed breach notification[^7]. The Authority emphasized that the controller failed to take reasonable measures to protect sensitive personal data as required under GDPR.

Separately, the attacker was criminally prosecuted and convicted for aggravated data breach, attempted extortion, and violations of personal privacy under Finnish criminal law.

---

## 5. Equivalent Legal Violations Under Philippine Law

If the Vastaamo incident occurred in the Philippines, similar conduct would likely constitute multiple violations under **Republic Act No. 10173 (Data Privacy Act of 2012)**.

### A. Access Due to Negligence

Failure to implement reasonable and appropriate organizational, physical, and technical security measures may constitute **accessing personal information due to negligence**, particularly where sensitive personal information is involved (Sec. 25, RA 10173)[^8].

**Penalty:**  
- Imprisonment of **three (3) to six (6) years**  
- Fine of **Php 500,000 to Php 4,000,000**

---

### B. Concealment of Security Breaches

Delayed notification to the National Privacy Commission (NPC) and affected data subjects would constitute **concealment of security breaches** (Sec. 26, RA 10173)[^9].

**Penalty:**  
- Imprisonment of **one (1) year and six (6) months to five (5) years**  
- Fine of up to **Php 1,000,000**

---

### C. Unauthorized Processing of Sensitive Personal Information

Psychotherapy records qualify as **sensitive personal information**, and improper handling or exposure may constitute **unauthorized processing** under Sections 3 and 13 of RA 10173[^10].

---

### D. Civil Liability

Independent of criminal liability, affected data subjects may pursue **civil damages**, including moral and exemplary damages, for harm suffered as a result of privacy violations (Sec. 38, RA 10173)[^11].

---

## 6. Legal Analysis

The Vastaamo breach illustrates how cybersecurity failures translate directly into regulatory and criminal liability. The absence of encryption, weak access controls, and prolonged undetected intrusion demonstrate a failure to meet baseline security standards required under both GDPR and Philippine data protection law.

Under Philippine jurisprudence, similar facts would likely support findings of **gross negligence**, exposing both the organization and responsible officers to criminal and civil liability.

---

## 7. Case Law and Regulatory Analogies (Philippines)

Although Philippine jurisprudence on large-scale cyber breaches is still developing, guidance may be drawn from decisions of the National Privacy Commission (NPC) and relevant Supreme Court rulings on privacy, negligence, and data protection principles.

### A. NPC v. Facebook Philippines, Inc. (Cambridge Analytica Incident)

In *NPC v. Facebook Philippines, Inc.*, the National Privacy Commission found that Facebook failed to adequately protect personal data and failed to comply with transparency and accountability obligations under the Data Privacy Act. The NPC emphasized that personal data controllers are responsible for ensuring reasonable and appropriate security measures, regardless of whether the breach was caused by a third party.

**Analogy to Vastaamo:**  
Similar to Facebook, Vastaamo failed to implement sufficient safeguards for sensitive personal data. Under Philippine standards, reliance on external attackers or absence of malicious intent would not absolve the organization from liability for inadequate security controls.

---

### B. NPC v. COMELEC (COMELEC “Comeleak” Case)

In *NPC v. Commission on Elections*, the NPC held COMELEC liable for failing to protect voter data after a massive data breach exposed personal information of millions of Filipino voters. The Commission emphasized that negligence in securing personal data systems constitutes a violation even without proof of intent.

**Analogy to Vastaamo:**  
The Vastaamo breach similarly involved prolonged unauthorized access and massive exposure of personal data. Under the reasoning applied in *COMELEC*, Vastaamo’s failure to detect and prevent access over an extended period would strongly support a finding of **access due to negligence** under Section 25 of RA 10173.

---

### C. Ople v. Torres (G.R. No. 127685, July 23, 1998)

In *Ople v. Torres*, the Supreme Court recognized the constitutional right to privacy and ruled that government data collection initiatives must be accompanied by adequate safeguards to prevent abuse and unauthorized disclosure.

**Analogy to Vastaamo:**  
While *Ople* involved state action, the Court’s emphasis on safeguards reinforces the principle that entities handling sensitive personal information—especially identity and health data—bear a heightened duty of care. Vastaamo’s failure to secure psychotherapy records would likely be viewed as a serious infringement of informational privacy under Philippine constitutional doctrine.

---

### D. Breach Notification and Accountability (NPC Advisory Opinions)

NPC advisory opinions consistently stress that delayed breach notification aggravates liability and reflects poor governance. Organizations are expected to maintain breach detection and response capabilities as part of their accountability obligations.

**Analogy to Vastaamo:**  
Vastaamo’s delayed detection and disclosure mirrors conduct that the NPC has previously cited as evidence of governance failure. Under Philippine regulatory practice, such delay would likely support findings of **concealment of security breaches** under Section 26 of RA 10173.

---

### E. Emerging Doctrine: Cybersecurity as a Standard of Care

Philippine data protection enforcement reflects an emerging doctrine that cybersecurity measures form part of an organization’s legal duty of care. Failure to encrypt sensitive personal information and monitor access logs may be construed as gross negligence when harm is foreseeable.

**Analogy to Vastaamo:**  
Given the foreseeability of harm from exposure of psychotherapy records, Vastaamo’s security failures would likely meet the threshold for aggravated liability under Philippine standards.

---

## 8. Synthesis

Applying Philippine case law and regulatory reasoning to the Vastaamo breach demonstrates that similar facts would likely result in findings of negligence, concealment, and civil liability. The incident illustrates how cybersecurity lapses are increasingly assessed through the lens of privacy rights, accountability, and institutional governance rather than purely technical failure.


## 7. Strategic Lessons

- Protection of health data requires heightened safeguards  
- Breach detection capabilities are a legal obligation  
- Delayed breach notification aggravates liability  
- Cyber governance failures can result in personal criminal exposure
